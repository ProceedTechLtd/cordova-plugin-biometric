# Biometric cordova plugin

This repository is a forked and customized version of the [original OutSystems cordova-plugin-fingerprint](https://github.com/OutSystems/cordova-plugin-fingerprint).

The original repository was cloned as a base, and additional code was added to support specific use cases â€” including user-facing functionality that allows choosing between facial recognition and fingerprint authentication.

All credit for the initial implementation goes to the OutSystems team.
This fork extends their work with logic and UI adjustments tailored to projects that require more granular biometric control.
